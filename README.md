# LendIt

### Lend today, borrow tomorrow.

### An application for borrowing and lending books, movies or games.

LendIt is a web application developed using the Django framework.

**It is designed to facilitate sharing of mostly one-time use commodities such as books, movies or games.**

One can easily put up items they want to lend with photos and specify the condition of the book and duration they want to lend for.
Searching is made equally easy by using Autocomplete. A map shows you lenders near your location.

Requesting a book sends a notification to the lender after which they can either accept or decline it.
In case they choose to accept, they can exchange their contact details and set up a meeting. An OTP exchange mechanism helps prevent fraud. Rating based mechanism to promote more trustable users.

Features to be:

- Integrate a mechanism to take care of caution money.
- Create an upvote/downvote algorithm.
