# LendIt

### Lend today, borrow tomorrow.

### An application for borrowing and lending books, movies or games.

LendIt is a web application developed in the InOut 3.0 Hackathon at NIT Surat. It is designed to facilitate sharing of mostly one-time use commodities such as books, movies or games.
One can easily put up items they want to lend with photos and specify the condition and duration they want to lend for.
Searching is made equally easy by using the [HavenOnDemand](https://dev.havenondemand.com/apis/querytextindex#overview) Search Query APIs and Autocomplete.
The results are arranged in increasing order of distance from the searcher and on basis of availability.

Requesting a book sends a notification to the lender after which they can either accept or decline it.
In case they choose to accept, they can exchange their contact details and set up a meeting.
